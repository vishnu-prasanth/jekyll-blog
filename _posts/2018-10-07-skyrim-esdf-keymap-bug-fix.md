title: "Skyrim Keymap Bug Fixes for ESDF Users (Incomplete)"
tags: skyrim video-games

There is something inherently wrong with the way the devs hard coded the menu keys for Skyrim, maybe its their tight deadlines or maybe they were just plain lazy since us ESDF users are the minority. In any case I haven't found an easy fix for this, what I have are some workarounds.<br>

The problem starts when anything other than WASD is used for character movement on vanilla Skyrim, in my case ESDF. Players naturally expect the menu navigation to be done with the same direction keys, but it doesn't work that way. Menu is hardcoded to WASD keys.<br>

As shown above the movement keys are assigned to E,S,D & F respectively while using the inventory, reading a book and the player location within the world map still uses E for Equip related functionality. How are the players supposed to navigate?<br>

Not only the E key but also the F key as well which is used to Favorite items in the inventory and for Finding locations in the world map.<br>
